This is a documentation intended for Interscript maintainers. It covers all possible tasks one
may need to execute.

== Releasing

The following is a set of steps one needs to make to do a release:

[source,sh]
---
# We assume this is executed in the main Interscript repository root directory.
# Adjust the V to reflect a correct version
V="2.1.0a1"
# Adjust the B to reflect a correct branch name. For now, master. In the future we may decide on
# how to do stable branches.
B="master"
# Commit command
COMMIT="git commit"
# Ensure we are on the latest repository version and all subrepos are up to date as well.
git checkout $B; git pull; git reset
pushd js; git checkout $B; git pull; git reset; popd
pushd maps; git checkout $B; git pull; git reset; popd
# This is the point when you may want to run tests and ensure everything is correct.
# Run the version update script
pushd ruby; bundle exec rake version[$V]; popd
# Add the new version to the submodules, commit it and tag it
pushd js; git add package.json; $COMMIT -m "Release v$V"; git tag "v$V"; popd
pushd maps; git add interscript-maps.gemspec; $COMMIT -m "Release v$V"; git tag "v$V"; popd
# Add the new version and submodules to the main repo, commit it and tag it
git add js maps ruby/lib/interscript/version.rb; $COMMIT -m "Release v$V"; git tag "v$V"
# Push everything in the correct order
pushd js; git push; git push --tags; popd
pushd maps; git push; git push --tags; popd
git push; git push --tags
# Our new version is released!
