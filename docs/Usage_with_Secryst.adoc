= Usage with Secryst

Secryst is a seq2seq transformer suited for transliteration. Written in Ruby.
It's installation is a bit tricky, you should consult its own installation guide
(https://github.com/secryst/secryst[at GitHub]). By default we don't use Secryst,
unless you have installed it.

== Using it standalone

It's enough to install it. Be sure to consult the guide above.

== Integration with Ruby Applications

In your Gemfile, add:

[source,ruby]
----
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "secryst"
----

Create a Secrystfile near your Gemfile with the following, for each model you
want to use in your application. Please consult our Secrystfile to get all the
maps needed to get all the Secryst maps needed.

[source,ruby]
----
model "model-name"
----

== Usage inside maps

[source,ruby]
----
stage {
  # ... sub "a", "b" ...
  secryst model: "model-name"
  # ... sub "c", "d" ...
}
----

As of now, Secryst is usable only by the Ruby implementation.
