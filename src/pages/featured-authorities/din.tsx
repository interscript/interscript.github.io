                (DIN) is the German national organization for standardization,
                headquartered in Berlin, and is the German ISO member body.

            <p>
              DIN publishes a number of transliteration systems that converts
              non-Latin scripts into a form suitable for the German-speaking
              populace. DIN transliteration systems are mandated for use in
              German organizations that rely on bibliographic information, such
              as in German national libraries.

                Systems listed here are ordered according to the alphabetical order of source language as spelled in
